Let’s take an example of testing a static website on a local machine.\nWe many options to do this, such as use nginx, nodejs express etc. Assume we want to use nginx, it would require nginx installation with a version we want. If we have an existing nginx version on a local machine then we would require it to be uninstalled before new version installation.\nHere comes docker with the solution, we don’t need to uninstall the existing version or install new nginx version on a local machine. Instead, we will be downloading nginx docker image on the local machine. </p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">docker pull nginx:1.15.5</code></pre></div>\n<p>Above command will download nginx 1.15.5 docker image on the local machine.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Docker for programmers","date":"October 06, 2018"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/docker-for-programmers/","previous":null,"next":null}}
